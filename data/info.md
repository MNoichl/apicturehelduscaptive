# Picturing the Mind

[project blog-post]()

[The Mind is a Metaphor](http://metaphors.iath.virginia.edu/metaphors?) is a great project by Brad Pasanek, in which he collects over 14000 literary metaphors for the mind, largely from the early modern period. In this piece of Art, I used an image generator that I had fine-tuned on paintings from the same period to generate illustrations for two thousand of these metaphors.

You can explore the results, in the collection to the right. You can zoom in with your mouse wheel (or touchpad) to investigate individual paintings. If you click on them, it will show you the text of the illustrated metaphor, and additional information about it. On some systems, images might at times appear blurry. Usually, zooming out a little, and back in fixes that.

If you choose the similarity view on the left, below this slider, you will be shown a mapping which arranges the illustrations by the semantic similarity of the underlying metaphors. And at the top of the illustration, you can sort the images by main categories, or search for specific words or authors.

**Disclaimer!** These illustrations are unfiltered AI-generations and therefore contain both scenes of violence and nudity, although only to an extent similar to what might be found in a public exhibition of classic art.
